### 1. **Foundations of GraphQL**

* What is GraphQL and how it differs from REST
* Benefits of GraphQL (single endpoint, strongly typed schema, avoids over/under-fetching)
* GraphQL architecture (client, server, schema, resolvers)

---

### 2. **Core Concepts**

* **Schemas and Types**
  * Scalar types (Int, Float, String, Boolean, ID)
  * Custom types
  * Object types
* **Queries**
  * Writing queries
  * Aliases and fragments
  * Variables in queries
* **Mutations**
  * Performing write operations
  * Arguments and input types
* **Subscriptions**
  * Real-time data
  * WebSockets in GraphQL

---

### 3. **Schema Design**

* Designing a GraphQL schema
* Relationships between types
* Input vs Output types
* Enum and Union types
* Interface and inheritance

---

### 4. **Resolvers**

* What resolvers are and how they work
* Field-level resolvers
* Query, Mutation, and Subscription resolvers
* Nested resolvers
* Resolver best practices

---

### 5. **GraphQL Server Development**

* Setting up a GraphQL server
  * Using Apollo Server (Node.js)
  * Using GraphQL Yoga, Express-GraphQL, or NestJS
* Connecting GraphQL to a database
* Error handling in resolvers
* Authentication and Authorization in GraphQL

---

### 6. **GraphQL Clients**

* Apollo Client basics
* Relay (optional, advanced)
* Fetching data from GraphQL APIs
* Caching and state management with Apollo
* Pagination strategies

---

### 7. **Advanced GraphQL Features**

* Directives (@include, @skip, @deprecated, custom directives)
* Batch requests with `@defer` and `@stream` (Apollo Federation / GraphQL spec updates)
* Schema stitching and federation
* GraphQL gateways and microservices
* Performance optimization (query cost analysis, depth limiting, caching)

---

### 8. **Security in GraphQL**

* Query complexity analysis
* Depth limiting to prevent DoS
* Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
* Authorization (role-based, field-level security)

---

### 9. **Testing GraphQL**

* Unit testing resolvers
* Integration testing with Apollo Server / Jest
* Mocking data for tests

---

### 10. **GraphQL Tools and Ecosystem**

* GraphiQL and GraphQL Playground
* Postman / Insomnia for GraphQL
* Code generation tools (GraphQL Codegen)
* Monitoring and logging

---

### 11. **Real-World Use Cases**

* Building a GraphQL API for an e-commerce app
* Implementing real-time chat with GraphQL subscriptions
* Connecting GraphQL with existing REST APIs
* GraphQL with microservices

---

### 12. **Deployment and Scaling**

* Deploying GraphQL server (Heroku, AWS, Vercel, etc.)
* Caching with Redis/CDN
* Load balancing for GraphQL
* Federation for scaling across teams
